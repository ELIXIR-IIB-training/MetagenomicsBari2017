# MetagenomicsBari2017
The Workshop and Summer School in Advanced Computational Metagenomics was held in Bari (Italy) in June 2017 (https://elixir-iib-training.github.io/website/2017/06/19/metagenomics-workshop-and-school-bari.html).

In this repository the slides showed during the workshop and the  materials used during the Summer School tutorials are availale.
